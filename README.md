# ECE482 p1

A shell written in C.

A full version of this repo is [here](https://focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/git/ece482-23fa/TingxiLi520021911041-p1).

The track of development lacks in this repo.

## Compiling and running
Use `CMakeLists.txt` to compile the project.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
You can find the executable file `shell` in `build` folder.



## Brief documentation
Yo can
- run some basic cammonds like `ls`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, etc.
- run built-in cammonds like `cd`, `pwd`, `exit`.
- redirect input and output with `>`, `>>`, `<`.
- pipe with `|`.
- use `Ctrl-C` to terminate the current running process.
- use `Ctrl-D` to exit the shell.
- get some error messages.
- over. I gave up.
